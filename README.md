# OmegaFun
An open source Discord.js bot with moderation &amp; fun commands! 👍
## You can use this without giving me credits, but giving them will be appreciated! 🙂

**To-Do list**:
- [ ] Multi Guild support
- [ ] Economy commands 
- [ ] Anti-Crash measures
- [ ] 8Ball command



**Note**:
1. Make sure to edit the role ids (check all command folders) 
2. Edit the .env file (read comments) or else the bot won't work!
3. This is my **first** discord.js bot don't expect it to be that great
4. If you have any suggestions, make sure to dm me on discord: __ImG#0001__
